#Edge-AI-Based-Faster-USB-Intrusion-Detector
This project presents a lightweight yet powerful Edge AI-based USB Intrusion Detection and Protection System, designed to secure computers from USB-borne threats â€” including malware, suspicious executables, and anomalous file behavior.

Unlike traditional antivirus solutions, this system operates offline, using machine learning and behavior analysis to identify and block malicious USB devices in real-time. It combines both signature-based (static file features) and behavior-based (USB usage patterns) scanning for comprehensive protection.
